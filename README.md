Repository for content used in SCoRE class videos.

SCoRE (Self-study Course on Reaction Engineering) class videos will consist of a single video. It will briefly summarize the information that students were assigned to read/watch prior to the class. This will be followed by a brief segment that puts the class in the context of the whole course. The bulk of the video will be a guided activity where the students use that information to perform reaction engineering tasks.

This project involves creation of slideshows that will be used to create the videos. The review material will be drawn from the RE_Basics, SCoRE_Preparation, and RE_Basics_Examples repositories. The activity material will be drawn from the SCoRE_Problems repository.
